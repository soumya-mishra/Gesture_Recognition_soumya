# Gesture_Recognition:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

- Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
- Stop: Pause the movie

The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use. 

 To get started with the model building process, you first need to get the data on your storage. 

In order to get the data on the storage, perform the following steps in order

- Open the terminal
- go down https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ehyrYBQ5rbQQe6yL4XbLWe3FMvuVUGiL
- unzip Project_data.zip
